# Pulser_Prediction
Pulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable here on Earth. 
They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the inter-stellar medium, and states of matter. 
Machine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. 
Classification systems in particular are being widely adopted,which treat the candidate data sets as binary classification problems.
#Machine Learning algoridham used
1] Logistic Regression
2] Decission Tree
3] Random Forest
4] KNeighborsClassifier

# Conclusion
A Matchine Learning model to Classify Pulser Neutron star in Pulser Dataset , the Model utilized Random Forest
Algorithm with SMOTE oversamplig techniques and achive accuracy of 96% and recall of 84% for Puser Class
the develoved model will help to identify Pulser Star  for further study
